# UX Booth Style Category Buttons

This demo illustrates how UX Booth uses SCSS to generate animated buttons in a way that is simple to maintain.

## Installation

    npm install

## SCSS Organization

UX Booth for the most part follows the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) methodology when it comes to naming and organizing classes. To customize colors used in the demo, you should modify `src/assets/sass/config/colors.scss`. To modify the category component itself, edit `src/assets/sass/components/categories.scss`.
